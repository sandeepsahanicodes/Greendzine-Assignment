# Greendzine-Assignment
Greendzine assignment for the role of graduate trainee software development.

Update:
- Got rejected after 2 weeks giving the face to face interview.
  
My Observations:

- Technical screening round was good thought i wasn't able to questions some of the React scenario based questions.
- Final technical round not went well as i became nervous, i messed up SQL and SpringBoot quesions.

Takeaways:
- Always be prepared according to role.
- Be confident and communicate clearly.
